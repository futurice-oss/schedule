Automate setting calendar invites for new employees

This is currently a prototype, any part may be rewritten or thrown away.

Setup:
=====
Make a Python virtual environment however you prefer, then:
pip install -r req.txt

Download ‘client-secrets.json’ from Google Dev Console (currently a test app).

The first time the code needs Google OAuth, it looks for client-secrets.json
in your current directory, prints a URL for you to authorize the app and get
an access token.
Credentials are stored in ‘a_credentials_file’ in your current dir.

Create all db tables (and optionally add an admin user):
manage.py syncdb

Populate your DB with FUM users:
― Get a JSON dump of FUM users
go run dump-fum-users.go -o users.json «AccessToken»
― TODO: add a python function which reads the JSON and creates the users
So far, in ‘manage.py shell’ we can type:
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from futuintro import FutuUser
fu = FutuUser()
fu.user = User.objects.all()[0]
fu.save()
User.objects.all()[0].futuuser

User.objects.all()[0].supervisor_of.count()
User.objects.all()[0].supervisor_of.all()
