Automate setting calendar invites for new employees

This is currently a prototype, any part may be rewritten or thrown away.

Setup:
=====
Make a Python virtual environment however you prefer, then:
pip install -r req.txt

Download ‘client-secrets.json’ from Google Dev Console (currently a test app).

The first time the code needs Google OAuth, it looks for client-secrets.json
in your current directory, prints a URL for you to authorize the app and get
an access token.
Credentials are stored in ‘a_credentials_file’ in your current dir.
