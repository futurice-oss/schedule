Automate setting calendar invites for new employees

This is currently a prototype, any part may be rewritten or thrown away.

Setup:
=====
The project uses Python3 and Django.

Make a Python3 virtual environment and install Django, e.g.:
virtualenv-3.4 my-env
. my-env/bin/activate
pip install Django

TODO: put the pip dependencies in requirements.txt or such (pip install -r â€¦)
but leave the virtualenv setup up to personal preference.

cd introsite
python manage.py syncdb
